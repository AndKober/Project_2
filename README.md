## **Project Overview**  
This **educational project** focuses on **analyzing job market trends** using SQL queries in **PostgreSQL**.  
The dataset is sourced from **HeadHunter**, a job search platform, and contains job postings, employer data, and salary details.  
The goal is to identify **key hiring trends, salary distributions, and demand for IT specialists**.  

## **Business Context**  
A data-driven approach to job market analysis helps:  
- **Job seekers** understand salary expectations and required skills.  
- **Recruiters** identify hiring trends and competition in specific regions.  
- **Data Scientists** develop **job recommendation models** based on structured data.  

## **Dataset**  
- **49,197 job listings** from **23,501 employers** across **1,362 regions**.  
- Includes job titles, salary ranges, employer details, required skills, and job locations.  
- Data is stored in a **relational PostgreSQL database** with multiple interconnected tables:
